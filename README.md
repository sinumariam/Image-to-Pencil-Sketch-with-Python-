# Image-to-Pencil-Sketch-with-Python-
Here is a sample project, Image to Pencil Sketch with Python which I completed as a part of my Data Science Internship. 
Many easy-to-use photo editor apps are now available to create pencil sketches of our photos. Some very basic commands are used here to plot the pencil sketch of an Image, which I think will be useful for beginners using Python Language for Image Processing.
